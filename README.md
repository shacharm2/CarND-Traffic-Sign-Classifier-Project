## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project, a structured convolutional network followed by a fully-connected network head learns the  [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The model is trained, validated and tested on the dataset and finally, evaluated on a small set of web images.

To meet the specifications, the project includes three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown and a pdf file 



# The Project
---

## Intro

The project consists of a deep neural network consisting of a few convolutional layers, stacked as both sequential and parallel inception layers to which attaches a fully connected classification network. 


## Goals

The steps of this project are presented as the following:

* Load the data set
* Dataset expolration and summerization
* Designing training and testing of the model architecture
* Using the model to make predictions on new images from the web
* Analyzing the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarizing the results with a written report


# Image preprocessing

Image preprocessing was done using 
    
    PreprocessingPipeline class()
